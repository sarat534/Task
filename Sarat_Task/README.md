# ClockPicker 
## Credits:
A clock-style timepicker for Bootstrap (or jQuery).

## Browser support

All major browsers are supported, including IE 9+. It should look and behave well enough in IE 8.

## Device support

Both desktop and mobile device are supported. It also works great in touch screen device.

## Dependencies

ClockPicker was designed for Bootstrap in the beginning. So Bootstrap (and jQuery) is the only dependency(s).

Since it only used `.popover` and some of `.btn` styles of Bootstrap, I picked these styles to build a jQuery plugin.
Feel free to use `jquery-*` files instead of `bootstrap-*` , for non-bootstrap project.
